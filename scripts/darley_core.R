# HYPOTHESIS 1 -------------------------------------------------------

# Participants will recommend higher punishment when the perpetrator acted in a jealous rage, compared to when the behavior was caused by an inoperable tumor .

# Standardized mean difference for punishment recommendation, for jealous rage vs. inoperable tumor

# HYPOTHESIS 2 -------------------------------------------------------

# Participants will recommend higher punishment when the perpetrator acted in a jealous rage, compared to when the behavior was caused by an operable tumor.

# Standardized mean difference for punishment recommendation, for jealous rage vs. operable tumor

# HYPOTHESIS 3 -------------------------------------------------------

# Participants will recommend higher punishment when the perpetrator acted because of an inoperable tumor, compared to when the behavior was caused by an operable tumor.

# Standardized mean difference for punishment recommendation, for operable tumor vs. inoperable tumor

# MANIPULATION CHECK 1 -----------------------------------------------

# Participants will select imprisonment at higher rates when the perpetrator acted in a jealous rage, compared to when the behavior was caused by (1) an inoperable tumor or (2) an operable tumor.

# Proportion differences (odds ratios) in selecting Imprisonment, for Scenario

# MANIPULATION CHECK 2 -----------------------------------------------

# Participants will select hospitalization at higher rates when the perpetrator acted because of an inoperable tumor, compared to when the behavior was caused by a jealous rage.
# Darley et al found a nonsignificant difference in preferring hospitalization between operable and inoperable tumors. We will assess this difference as well.

# Proportion differences (odds ratios) in selecting Hospitalization, for Scenario

# MANIPULATION CHECK 3 -----------------------------------------------

# Participants will select release at higher rates when the perpetrator acted because of an operable tumor that has now been treated, compared to when the behavior was caused by (1) an inoperable tumor or (2) a jealous rage.

# Proportion differences (odds ratios) in selecting Release, for Scenario
