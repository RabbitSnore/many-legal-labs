#######################################################################

# HYPOTHESIS 1 --------------------------------------------------------

# Participants are faster at making a correct decision to shoot, when the target holds a gun, than the correct decision to not shoot, when the target does not hold a gun.

# Standardized mean difference in Mean Response Latency for Object Type, across Ethnicity

# HYPOTHESIS 2 --------------------------------------------------------

# Participants are faster to fire at an armed target if the target is African American than if the target is White.

# Standardized mean difference in Mean Response Latency for Ethnicity, for Gun trials

# HYPOTHESIS 3 --------------------------------------------------------

# Participants are faster to not fire at an unarmed target if the target is White than if the target is African American.

# Standardized mean difference in Mean Response Latency for Ethnicity, for No-Gun trials

# HYPOTHESIS 4 --------------------------------------------------------

# Participants are more likely to shoot an unarmed target (i.e., false alarms) than to not-shoot an armed target (i.e., misses).

#  Standardized mean difference in Errors for Object Type, across Ethnicity
